Potential Stakeholders - Banks, Start-up company, Self

8/25/2016

Background of this research is to gather data as it relates to peoples' financial goals and their ability to track their net worth in an easy way that protects their privacy.  Fraud is prevelant now and not everybody wants to share the credentials to their bank accounts and credit cards so their finances can be automatically tracked.  Many of the current apps that exist make it easy to have finances automatically tracked, they either don't provide the option to manually track them, or they make it difficult to use.  

Conducting the study to see if their is a demand for an app like this, and gather data on what people like and dislike about some of the more popular apps on the market.  (Mint, Personal Capital, Bank Apps, Stock Apps)

Research Questions

1.  What percentage of people use one app tracks their net worth?  Not just a different app from a bank for every credit card or bank account they have.

2.  How concerned are people about security when it relates to providing log in data to third party apps that automatically track net worth.  

3.  How many people actively set and follow budgets?  Would a built in feature to track a budget be useful?

4.  How many people have money tied into the markets?  Would the ability to track stock/etf prices in real time be useful?

5.  How would people feel about a secure way to track a portfolio manually instead of providing brokerage credentials?  (API calls would be done and stock price would be multiplied by the number of shares owned)

Methodology

Some basic online surveys and in person interviews will be conducted.

Participants will include a wide range of people, older people and younger people.  Anyone who expresses an interest in tracking personal finances in a more secure way.
